# Laboratory and computational prediction of patient outcomes in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains the only curative therapy for many hematologic malignancies and bone marrow failure syndromes. However, despite advances in donor selection, conditioning regimens, and supportive care, transplantation continues to be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Development of prognostic tools and identification of risk factors remains a central goal in the treatment of HSCT patients. Here we performed a retrospective analysis of 500 patients who received allogeneic HSCT at our institution between 2019-2024. Patients who achieved a platelet count of 90,000/uL by day 30 post-transplant demonstrated significantly improved overall survival, highlighting the utility of incorporating early post-transplant hematologic recovery into risk stratification models. Through statistical modeling and multivariate analyses, we identified several high-risk patient groups including older age; low CD34+ cell dose; those with comorbidities including vascular disease and gastroesophageal reflex; and distinct medication use. Finally, through a novel machine learning-based approach, we demonstrate markedly improved predictive accuracy of patient outcomes with incorporation of post-transplant laboratory data. These findings underscore the importance of integrating baseline patient factors and early post-transplant laboratory parameters into prognostic models to inform personalized transplant management and surveillance strategies.
